## Codecademy is sole the creator of the content listed within each of these directory's - JS, jQuery

While I was working on Codecademy's courses I copied down the JavaScript track and the jQuery track lessons and exercises into my own code editor.

I did this **only** for the sole purpose of learning. I personally believe the more you have your hands on the keyboard the better. Therefore I typed out each line of code that was presented to me through there courses.
